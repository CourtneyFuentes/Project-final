This game was developed as a final project for C220 as part of a 48-hour game jam. 

When we considered the theme of coronavirus, we thought about it this way: we want to create a 2D game, like preventing the virus to hurt you.

These are the struggles and surprises we encountered as we developed it: we are both not good at programming, so i use some tutorial to finish the project. The enemy can't move, probably is the different godot version.

These are the technologies and resources we used: Godot3.2

This is the objective of the game: dodge the virus and keep alive.

This is how the game is played: move the player with wasd and stay away from the virus.

Future plans: find a team to create a better game.

The contributions of each teammate: Haoyu Lin, programming. Zixi Liu, making music. The bgm is written by his own.
